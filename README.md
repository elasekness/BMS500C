# BMS500C
Tutorials for BMS500C 2023 class

The overall objectives of this session are 
  1) to become familiar with navigating in a command-line (Linux) environment.
  2) to perform basic and more sophisticated command-line operations (such as using regex, piping, and for-loops) to parse and manipuate data
  3) to learn the basic operations for performing a reference-based assembly, calling variants, and evaluating the results
  4) to generate viral phylogenies, assess relationships among isolates, and look for temporal and geographical signals.

West Nile Virus 
We will be downloading next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) on NCBI for several West Nile Virus samples.
We will map the sequence reads in the fastq files to a reference WNV genome to generate reference-based assemblies.
